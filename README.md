## Installation
Start by installing node to use npm calls. Make sure to type 'npm install' in the root directory once the code is cloned. This will install all the dependencies you need to run the application.

## Features
Here are some of our favorite features of the application:

- Readers can view and read any projects in the database without an account.
- Readers can search for titles using keywords and genre
- If a writer wants to sign up, they can do so and then all of their writing projects can be compiled and stored within the application.
- Writers can approve or reject edits from editors or collaborators on their work.
- Community for avid readers and writers to meet and interact

## How to Use
Use React and node.Js to run the application and work on the code.

## Roadmap
In the future, we want to add more to the application to make it even more useful and intuitive. Some of those updates include:

- Role tags for publishers, authors, contributors, mentors, etc.
- Include seeking collaborators as an option to select in Search
- Apply to Collaborate Modal that includes qualifications
- Ability to submit Book Cover art and view it
